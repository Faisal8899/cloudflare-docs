To make the most of this learning path, make sure that you have the following:

- A device that can run [WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/), Cloudflare's endpoint agent.
- A private network with applications or services that are available locally or via a VPN.
- A host server that can run the lightweight Cloudflare Tunnel daemon process, egress to the Internet on the [required ports](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/), and connect locally to the private network applications.
- (Optional) A [Linux host server](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/#linux) that can run the Cloudflare WARP Connector, requisite for server-initiated traffic flows, Microsoft SCCM, Active Directory (AD) updates, and DevOps workflows.
