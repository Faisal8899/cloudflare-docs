An [identity provider (IdP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/) stores and manages usersâ€™ digital identities. You can integrate your existing identity provider with Cloudflare Zero Trust in order to manage user access to your private network. This requires configuration both in Cloudflare and with the identity provider itself.

Some admins choose to test by authenticating with a one-time PIN (OTP) instead of an IdP. With OTP, Cloudflare will send a temporary login code to approved email addresses. OTP can also be used as an alternative login method for contractors or other guests that are not part of your organization.
