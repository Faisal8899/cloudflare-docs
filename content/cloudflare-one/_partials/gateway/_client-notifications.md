Turn on **Display block notification for WARP client** to display notifications for block events. Blocked users will receive an operating system notification from the WARP client with either the default message or a custom message you set.

Upon selecting the notification, WARP will direct your users to a block page. Optionally, you can enter a custom URL to direct users to a custom URL, such as support.
